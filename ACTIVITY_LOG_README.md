  "details": "string",
  "target_id": "string",
  "target_type": "string",
  "timestamp": "datetime",
  "ip_address": "string",

}
```

## Tracked Actions

### Authentication
- **Login**: User successfully logs into the system
- **Logout**: User logs out of the system

### Client Management
- **Create Client**: New client assessment is created
- **Approve Client**: Client is approved for treatment
- **Reject Client**: Client application is rejected
- **Archive Client**: Client record is archived
- **Flag Client**: Client is flagged for review
- **Send to Aftercare**: Client is transferred to aftercare
- **Complete Treatment**: Client treatment is marked as completed

### User Management
- **Create User**: New user account is created
- **Update User**: User information or permissions are updated
- **Delete User**: User account is deleted

### System Operations
- **View Reports**: System reports are accessed
- **Export Data**: Data is exported from the system

## Implementation Details

### Logging Function

The system uses a centralized `log_activity()` function:

```python
def log_activity(user_id, user_email, user_role, action, details=None, target_id=None, target_type=None):
    # Logs activity to Firestore
```

### Automatic Logging

Activities are automatically logged when:
- Users log in/out
- Clients are created, approved, rejected, or archived
- Users are created, updated, or deleted
- System operations are performed

### Manual Logging

Additional activities can be logged manually by calling:

```python
log_activity(
    user_id=session['user_id'],
    user_email=session['email'],
    user_role=session['role'],
    action='Custom Action',
    details='Description of the action',
    target_id='object_id',
    target_type='object_type'
)
```

## API Endpoints

## Setup and Testing

### Populate Sample Data

To populate the activity logs with sample data for testing:

```bash
python populate_activity_logs.py
```

This script will create 200 sample activity logs spanning the past 30 days.

### Manual Testing

1. **Login as Admin**: Access the system with admin credentials
2. **Navigate to Activity Log**: Click on "Activity Log" in the sidebar
3. **Test Filters**: Try filtering by user, action, and date
4. **Test Export**: Use the export button to download CSV
5. **Test Search**: Use the search functionality to find specific activities

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Activity logs contain sensitive information
- Access is restricted to admin users only
- IP addresses are logged for security purposes
- User agent strings help identify client devices

### Data Retention
- Activity logs are stored indefinitely
- Consider implementing data retention policies
- Regular backups should include activity logs

### Audit Trail
- All admin actions are logged
- No admin action can bypass logging
- Logs provide complete audit trail for compliance

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Notifications**: Notify admins of suspicious activities
- **Activity Analytics**: Charts and graphs for activity patterns
- **Advanced Filtering**: More granular filtering options
- **Bulk Operations**: Bulk export and management of logs
- **Integration**: Integration with external security systems

### Performance Optimizations
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large log volumes
- **Indexing**: Database indexing for faster queries
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed log data
- **Compression**: Compress old log data for storage efficiency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Activities Showing**
   - Check if the `activity_logs` collection exists in Firestore
   - Verify admin permissions
   - Run the populate script to add sample data

2. **Export Not Working**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Ensure sufficient data exists for export

3. **Filters Not Working**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check URL parameters
   - Verify filter values match existing data

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to `app.py`:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Support
